# Solution: Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree

This solution calculates the **maximum path sum** in a binary tree. The path can begin and end at any node, and it does not need to pass through the root.

## Explanation of the Approach

### 1. **Global Variable (`result`)**
- A global variable `result` is used to store the maximum path sum encountered during the traversal of the tree.
- It is initialized to `Int32.MinValue` to ensure any computed path sum will replace it.

### 2. **Post-order Traversal**
- The solution uses a **post-order traversal** (left ‚Üí right ‚Üí root) to explore the tree.
- This ensures that for each node, the maximum contributions from its left and right subtrees are computed before processing the node itself.

### 3. **Handling Negative Contributions**
- If a subtree contributes a negative path sum, it is better to exclude it, as it would decrease the overall path sum.
- To achieve this, the solution uses:
  ```csharp
  leftMax = Math.Max(leftMax, 0);
  rightMax = Math.Max(rightMax, 0);
  ```
   
### 4. **Updating the Global Maximum**
- For each node, the potential maximum path sum that includes the current node as the highest point (root of the path) is calculated as:
```csharp
root.val + leftMax + rightMax
```
This value is compared with the global result variable, and result is updated if this value is larger.

### 5. **Returning to the Parent**
After calculating the maximum path sum involving the current node, the function needs to return the maximum contribution this node can provide to its parent.
This is given by:
```csharp
root.val + Math.Max(leftMax, rightMax)
```
It includes the node's value and the greater of the left or right subtree's contribution.  

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: 
ùëÇ(ùëõ) Each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.
- Space Complexity: 
ùëÇ(‚Ñé) The space required is proportional to the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
